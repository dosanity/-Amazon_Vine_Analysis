# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview
Amazon Vine is an invitation-only program which selects the most insightful reviewers in the Amazon store to serve as Vine Voices. Vine Voices have the unique opportunity to order items free of charge and share their product experiences with Amazon customers to help them make informed buying decisions. We are tasked to analyze Amazon reviews written by Vine Voices to determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in 5-star reviews.
