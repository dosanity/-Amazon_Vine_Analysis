# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview
Amazon Vine is an invitation-only program which selects the most insightful reviewers in the Amazon store to serve as Vine Voices. Vine Voices have the unique opportunity to order items free of charge and share their product experiences with Amazon customers to help them make informed buying decisions. We are tasked to analyze Amazon reviews written by Vine Voices to determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in 5-star reviews.

## Summary

+ Positivity Bias:
  + Based on this specific dataset of video game reviews, our analysis indicates that there are some bias towards 5-star reviews with the comparison of Vine reviews (paid) and Non-Vine reviews (unpaid). In the analysis above, the reviews that were paid for by Vine had a higher percentage of 5-star reviews than those that were not paid. 51.06% of the Vine reviews that were paid had 5-star ratings while only 38.70% of the Vine reviews that were not paid had 5-star ratings.
